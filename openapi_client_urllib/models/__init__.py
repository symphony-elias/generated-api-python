    Login API

    For bots and other on-premise processes to authenticate. Once authenticated, the bot will be able to use the methods described in serviceAPI.yaml and agentAPI.yaml.  Authentication requests will expect the user to pass a token containing user identification information and signed by the user's private key  There will be two implementations of this API, one on your Pod and one on the Key Manager. In order to fully authenticate, an API client will have to call both of these implementations and pass both of the session tokens returned as headers in all subsequent requests to the Symphony API.   # noqa: E501
