    Agent API

    This document refers to Symphony API calls to send and receive messages and content. They need the on-premise Agent installed to perform decryption/encryption of content.  - sessionToken and keyManagerToken can be obtained by calling the authenticationAPI on the symphony back end and the key manager respectively. Refer to the methods described in authenticatorAPI.yaml. - Actions are defined to be atomic, ie will succeed in their entirety or fail and have changed nothing. - If it returns a 40X status then it will have sent no message to any stream even if a request to aome subset of the requested streams would have succeeded. - If this contract cannot be met for any reason then this is an error and the response code will be 50X. - MessageML is a markup language for messages. See reference here: https://rest-api.symphony.com/docs/messagemlv2 - **Real Time Events**: The following events are returned when reading from a real time messages and events stream (\"datafeed\"). These events will be returned for datafeeds created with the v5 endpoints. To know more about the endpoints, refer to Create Messages/Events Stream and Read Messages/Events Stream. Unless otherwise specified, all events were added in 1.46.   # noqa: E501
